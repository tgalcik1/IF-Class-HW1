Our game, "Escape From Quarantine Zone", takes place in a post-apocalyptic environment where the player must escape from
a desolate city. They must cleverly make use of sparsely placed objects and weapons to find their way to a northern forest haven.
They run into several obstacles during their journey, including a barricaded grocery store, a zombie encounter, and a quarantine
guard restricting anyone from entering or leaving the quarantine zone. Our main inspirations for this topic include The Last of Us
and Half Life 2, both of which also take place in similar sci-fi post-apocalyptic worlds.
