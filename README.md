IF-Class-HW1: Build a Text-Adventure Game

Task 1 (action_castle.ipynb), task 2 (my_game.ipynb), playthrough.txt and the graph image are located in the 'homeworks' directory.

Our game, "Escape From Quarantine", takes place in a post-apocalyptic environment where the player must escape from
a desolate city. They must cleverly make use of sparsely placed objects and weapons to find their way to a northern forest haven.
They run into several obstacles during their journey, including a barricaded grocery store, a zombie encounter, and a quarantine
guard restricting anyone from entering or leaving the quarantine zone. Attempting to hit the zombie with a blunt weapon will
result in one of the three lose states possible.

Our main inspirations for this topic include The Last of Us and Half Life 2, both of which also take place in similar 
sci-fi, post-apocalyptic worlds.
